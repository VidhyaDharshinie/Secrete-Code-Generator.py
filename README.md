# Secret Code Generator (Caesar Cipher)

## 📖 Project Description
This is a simple Python program that encodes and decodes messages using the **Caesar Cipher** technique.  
The Caesar Cipher works by shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number, wrapping around when needed.  
It’s one of the oldest encryption methods, used by Julius Caesar to protect messages.
